    <header> Ingredients </header>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 1/2 pounds Russet potatoes</li>
        <li> oil for frying I use vegetable or peanut oil</li>
        <li> salt and pepper to taste </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon chopped parsley optional</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into matchsticks, either with a knife or with a french fry cutter. The potato pieces should all be similar in size.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Soak the potatoes for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the potatoes. Place the potatoes on a layer of paper towels and pat thoroughly with additional towels until dry.</li>
        <li>Pour 3 inches of oil into a large, deep pot. Heat the oil to 300 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Place about 1/3 of the potatoes in the pot, and cook until tender. This takes about 4-5 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat of the oil to 400 degrees F. Place 1/3 of the potatoes back in the pot and cook for an additional 1-3 minutes or until golden brown. 
            Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes. Place the cooked potatoes on a sheet pan lined with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste over the fries. Add parsley if desired, then serve immediately.</li>
